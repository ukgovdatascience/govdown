# Govdown

::: {.lead-para}
Govdown is an R package for creating websites and standalone HTML pages that use
the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).  This website
is an example.
:::

Use govdown in the same way as [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/),
but specify `output: govdown::govdown_document` instead of `output:
html_document` in the YAML metadata of the document, or in the `_site.yml` file
of the website.

> You can't publish govdown documents on the GOV.UK website itself. Please
> follow the normal guidance for [how to publish on
> GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk).

## Examples

These websites and documents use govdown.

* https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap-website/
* https://co-analysis.github.io/csmapping/cs_lad_2019.html ([2018 version](https://co-analysis.github.io/csmapping/cs_lad_2018.html))
* https://mattkerlogue.github.io/coding-guide/
* https://matt-dray.github.io/drake-egg-rap/egg-report.html

## Installation

You can install the released version of govdown from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("govdown")
```

And the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/govdown/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools") # if devtools is not already installed
devtools::install_github("ukgovdatascience/govdown")
```

You need Pandoc version 2.0 or greater on your system to use Govdown.  You can
check which version you have at the R console by typing
`rmarkdown::pandoc_version()`.  Look at this [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/govdown/issues/2) for advice on how
to obtain a more recent version of pandoc.

## Shiny

If you are developing a Shiny application, then look at
https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/shinyGovstyle.

## Crosstalk

If you use the [crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) package for
interactive commponents, then use the `govdown::unstrap()` function to prevent
them from interfering with how the page is rendered.

## Creating standalone HTML pages

Govdown HTML pages are created in the same way as R Markdown HTML pages.  Write
a markdown document (a plain text file with the suffix `.Rmd` instead
of `.txt`), and put something called 'YAML metadata' at the top.  It should look
like this:

```yaml
---
output:
  govdown::govdown_document:
    font: "sans-serif" # (default) or "new-transport"
    favicon: "custom" # or "none" (default) or "govuk" see ?govdown_document
    logo: "images/logo.svg" # or false (default)
    logo_url: "https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/govdown/"
    logo_text: "logo_text"
    page_title: "page_title"
    title: "title"
    phase: alpha
    feedback_url: "https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/govdown/issues"
    google_analytics: "UA-12345678-90"
---
```

    This is a study of official statistics in the UK.

To render that file to HTML, run `rmarkdown::render("filename.Rmd")` in the
console, or click the 'knit' button in RStudio.

You must use `font: "sans-serif"` unless the page is hosted on the gov.uk
domain.

## Creating websites

Websites are created in the same way as R Markdown websites.  Write
a set of markdown documents (plain text files with the suffix `.Rmd` instead
of `.txt`), and a configuration file called `_site.yml` with content like the
following:

```yaml
output_dir: docs # to host on GitHub pages
navbar: # links to include in the bar at the top of every page
  - text: "Home"
    href: index.html
  - text: "Tech docs"
    href: tech-docs.html
  - text: "News"
    href: NEWS.html
output:
  govdown::govdown_document:
    font: "sans-serif" # (default) or "new-transport"
    favicon: "custom" # or "none" (default) or "govuk" see ?govdown_document
    logo: "images/logo.svg" # or false (default)
    logo_url: "https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/govdown/"
    logo_text: "logo_text"
    page_title: "page_title"
    title: "title"
    phase: alpha
    feedback_url: "https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/govdown/issues"
    google_analytics: "UA-12345678-90"
```

That example shows all the possible configuration.  You don't have to set a
`logo` or `favicon` or have any `links` (although you probably should
eventually), and if you don't set an alpha or beta `phase` banner then you won't
need a `feedback_url`.  However you must set `font: "sans-serif"` unless the
website is hosted on the gov.uk domain.  Set `output_dir: docs` if you will
deploy the site on GitHub pages, otherwise refer to the R Markdown documentation
on [publishing
websites](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html#publishing-websites).

To render the website, run `rmarkdown::render_site()` in the
console, or click the 'Build Website' button in RStudio Build panel.

## Supported markdown syntax

Most of the usual markdown syntax is supported.  There is some new syntax for
special features of the GOV.UK Design System.

Where syntax isn't supported, that might be because research by contributors to
the GOV.UK Design System found the features to be detrimental. Govdown defers to
the GOV.UK Design System in these cases.

### Headings

Create headings by beginning a new line of text with a `#` symbol.

```md
# Pithy heading

Rambling content.
```

Subheadings have more `#`s

```md
## Helpful subheading

### Can't remember what the main topic was?

#### Four levels of headings are available!
```

### Headings with captions {caption="This is a caption"}

The GOV.UK Design System supports captions above
[headings](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#headings).
This works for headings of level 1, 2 and 3, but not for the smallest headings
(level 4).

```md
# Heading with caption above {caption="This is a caption"}
```

### Bold, italics and strike-through

**Bold** works as normal, but *italics* and ~~strike-through~~ are disabled
because they are not supported by the GOV.UK Design System.

```md
**Bold** works as normal, but *italics* and ~~strike-through~~ are disabled.
```

### Lead paragraphs and small text

The GOV.UK Design System supports [larger and smaller text for
paragraphs](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#paragraphs).
Large text is for a single lead paragraph at the top of a page.  See the top of
this page for an example.

::: {.small-para}
Small text looks like this.
:::

```md
::: {.lead-para}
This is a lead paragraph that appears in larger text than the rest of the body
text of the page.
:::

This is a normal paragraph in normal size.

::: {.small-para}
You can write in small letters too.
:::
```

### Indented text (quotations)

Indented text (often used for block quotations) works as normal.

> United wishes and good will cannot overcome brute facts.  Truth is
> incontrovertible. Panic may resent it. Ignorance may deride it. Malice may
> distort it. But there it is. -- Winston Churchill

```md
> United wishes and good will cannot overcome brute facts.  Truth is
> incontrovertible. Panic may resent it. Ignorance may deride it. Malice may
> distort it. But there it is. -- Winston Churchill
```

### Warnings

Use the [Warning
text](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/warning-text/) when you
need to warn users about something important, such as legal consequences of an
action, or lack of action, that they might take.

::: {.warning}
Fee fi fo fum
:::

```md
::: {.warning}
Fee fi fo fum
:::
```

### Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks work as normal.  The GOV.UK Design System also supports [hyperlinks
that don't change
colour](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#links){.no-visited-state}
when you have visited the page.

```md
[normal hyperlink](https://design-system.service.gov.uk).

[hyperlink that doesn't turn purple](https://design-system.service.gov.uk){.no-visited-state}.
```

### Bullets and numbered lists

Bulletted and nested lists work as normal, except that nested lists don't look
very good because they aren't supported by the GOV.UK Design System.  Govdown
defers to the designers who made this decision, but if you have evidence of a
need for nested lists, please submit it to the GOV.UK Design System by opening a
new GitHub issue on the [GOV.UK frontend
repository](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues).

* First bullet
  * Nested bullets are available but ...
  * ... they don't look very good because the GOV.UK Design System doesn't
    really support them.
* Second bullet
* Third bullet

```md
* First bullet
  * Nested bullets are available but ...
  * ... they don't look very good because the GOV.UK Design System doesn't
    really support them.
* Second bullet
* Third bullet
```

1. Numbered list item
1. Second numbered list item
1. Third numbered list item

```md
1. Numbered list item
1. Second numbered list item
1. Third numbered list item
```

The GOV.UK Design System also supports lists with neither bullets nor numbers.
Standard markdown doesn't have any syntax for this, so create a bulletted list
and wrap it with a special marker, shown below.

::: {.unbulleted-list}
* Unbulleted item one
* Unbulleted item two
* Unbulleted item three
:::

```md
::: {.unbulleted-list}
* Unbulleted item one
* Unbulleted item two
* Unbulleted item three
:::
```

### Section breaks

The usual section break is available.

```md
---
```

---

The GOV.UK Design System supports several
sizes of section break; govdown uses the largest.  For the other sizes use the
[raw
HTML](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#section-break).

```html
<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">
<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--l govuk-section-break--visible">
<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">
<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible">
```

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">
<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--l govuk-section-break--visible">
<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">
<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--visible">

</br>

### Breadcrumbs

The GOV.UK Design System uses
[breadcrumbs](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/breadcrumbs/) to
help users know where they are on a website.  They are used at the top of a
page.

::: {.breadcrumbs}
* [trail](index.html)
* [of](index.html)
* breadcrumbs
:::

```md
::: {.breadcrumbs}
* [trail](index.html)
* [of](index.html)
* breadcrumbs
:::
```

### Tabsets

Tabs can be a helpful way of letting users quickly switch between related
information.  See the guidance on the [GOV.UK Design
System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tabs/).

The syntax is different from normal R Markdown tabsets.

```md
::: {.tabset}
# Heading appears on narrow screens

## Tab heading 1

Tab content A

## Tab heading 2

Tab content B

Second paragraph of content.
:::
```

::: {.tabset}
# Heading appears on narrow screens

## Tab heading 1

Tab content A

## Tab heading 2

Tab content B

Second paragraph of content.
:::

### Accordions

The accordion component lets users show and hide sections of related content on
a page.  See the guidance on the [GOV.UK Design
System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/).

The syntax is similar to govdown tabsets.

```md
::: {.accordion}
## Writing well for the web

This is the content for Writing well for the web.

## Writing well for specialists

This is the content for Writing well for specialists.

## Know your audience

This is the content for Know your audience.

## How people read

This is the content for How people read.
:::
```

::: {.accordion}
## Writing well for the web

This is the content for Writing well for the web.

## Writing well for specialists

This is the content for Writing well for specialists.

## Know your audience

This is the content for Know your audience.

## How people read

This is the content for How people read.
:::

</br>

### Details

Details make a page easier to scan by letting users reveal more detailed
information only if they need it. As with Tabs, guidance can be found on the
[GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/).

The syntax uses the summary attribute to provide the top level information with
the content provided by the text within.

:::{.warning}
The details component requires Pandoc version 2.5 or more recent.
:::

```md
::: {.details summary="Details"}

Here are some details on the
[Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service).

Multiple paragraphs can be contained in details.

:::
```

::: {.details summary="Details"}

Here are some details on the
[Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service).

Multiple paragraphs can be contained in details.

:::

### Code blocks

Code blocks work the same as they do in markdown and R Markdown.  Code in R
Markdown files (.Rmd suffix) will be evaluated, and the result interleaved below
the code.

```r
print("This code will not be evaluated")
```
```{r}
print("This code will be evaluated")
```
Create code chunks that are not to be evaluated using a plain markdown R code chunk as follows.

````
```r
print("This code will not be evaluated")
```
````

Or specify an R Markdown R code chunk with the option `eval=FALSE` as follows.

````
```{r eval=FALSE}`r ''`
print("This code will not be evaluated")
```
````

Create code chunks that are to be evaluated as follows (of course you can also explicitly set chunk option `eval=TRUE`).

````
```{r}`r ''`
print("This code will be evaluated")
```
````

Python code chunks also work (as long as you have the reticulate package and Python installed), as do any of the languages supported by knitr. For example,

````
```{python}`r ''`
'Monty Python'.split()
```
````

produces the following.

```{python}
'Monty Python'.split()
```

### Images

Images use the normal markdown syntax.

![caption text](./favicon/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png)

Or you can use the `knitr::include_graphics()` function in an R Markdown R code chunk.

### Tables

All four kinds of [pandoc tables](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#tables)
work.  Below is a common kind.  Note that only left-aligned and
right-aligned columns are supported in the GOV.UK Design System, and captions
always appear above the table.

    Table: This is a table caption.

    | Right | Left | Default | Center |
    |------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
    |   12  |  12  |    12   |    12  |
    |  123  |  123 |   123   |   123  |
    |    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  |

Table: This is a table caption.

| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
|   12  |  12  |    12   |    12  |
|  123  |  123 |   123   |   123  |
|    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  |

    Another table without a caption.

    | Right | Left | Default | Center |
    |------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
    |   12  |  12  |    12   |    12  |
    |  123  |  123 |   123   |   123  |
    |    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  |

Another table without a caption.

| Right | Left | Default | Center |
|------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
|   12  |  12  |    12   |    12  |
|  123  |  123 |   123   |   123  |
|    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  |

Tables can also be created from code chunks.  This example in R uses
`knitr::kable()`.

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 1:4]))
```

If kable doesn't produce a table that looks like the one above, then try using
the `format` argument, for example `kable(mtcars, format = "markdown")` or
`kable(mtcars, format = "pandoc")`.  You will need to do that if the
`kableExtra` package is loaded, because `kableExtra` sets a global option.
Check the value of `getOption("knitr.table.format")` to see if that option has
been set.  If `kableExtra` isn't loaded, then the option might be set in your
`.Rprofile`, which you can open with `usethis::edit_r_profile()`.

### Mathematical equations

Mathjax is supported as normal, by wrapping the equation in `$` symbols (inline
equations) or in `$$` symbols on their own line (block equations).

Here's some inline mathjax $\sum_0^{2e} \alpha_i \mathrm{dt}$.
Here's some block mathjax

$$
\begin{align}
s_i & \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(n_i, p_i) \\
\mathrm{logit}(p_i) & = \alpha_{\small{TANK}[i]} \\
\alpha_{\small{TANK}} & \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, 5)
\end{align}
$$

## Contribute to the development of govdown

Use `install-govuk-frontend.sh` to download, modify and compile the GOV.UK Design System to get the css files for the templates.

### Prerequisites

The `sassc` command-line tool.  If you can't get that to work, try the `sass`
package by RStudio, which wraps it.
